                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello, my name is Brandon Hawke, and I am a first year Game Design and Development major at RIT, and I hail from Guilford, Connecticut.
                Besides my passion for making video games, I am also a left-handed guitarist, who mainly plays pop punk.<p>  
                <p>During my four years in high school, I started making storyboards for my video game ideas. By the end of Junior year,
                   I finished my first full-length game storyboard, as well as making the "company" Flaming Ember Production Studios.
                   Although four years have past since starting the game, I have not given up on completing it.<p>  
                </p>While at RIT, I plan on finishing my game, developing it, and bringing it to fruition.
                Although I have to wait a bit to learn C#, until then, I will continue making game ideas.</p>
