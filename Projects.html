            <h2>Pop Culture: A Series That Started From Nothing</h2>
            <p>In the spring of 2015, I talked with a friend in Wisconsin about a game idea I had. A game series that would incorporate certains areas of pop culture and make a game with the area in mind.
                The first of these areas of pop culture to transform into a game was the British TV show that my mother and I are very fond of, Doctor Who. Although there have been previous Doctor Who video games, very few were released outside of the EU, 
                in addition to poor reviews and reception. For the next two-and-a-half years, I worked on completing the storyboard for the game. At the end of my Junior Year of High school, the final script was finished, but due to the disadvantage of only having myself 
                work on every aspect of the game (coding, level design, artwork, music, etc), I was unable to finish the game before its multiple deadlines. At this moment in time, the game still remains on hiatus until I can work with C# and assemble a team to help build the game. 
            </p>
            <p> </p>
            <p> In addtion to Pop Culture: Doctor Who, I also briefly worked on the storyboard for Pop Culture: Attack on Titan, a game that was based off the series but had an entirely different storyline. In 2017, I tried to build and release a demo of the gameplay, but to avail.
                At this moment in time, this game also remains on hiatus, and I will continue to write the storyboard for the game in the near future.
            </p>
